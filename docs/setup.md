## Generate a boilerplate for NextJs with cloudflare

- `npm create cloudflare@latest my-next-app -- --framework=next` - This will ask some questions, like do you want Typescript, linter, App Router of Pages Router and of you want to deploy. If you have a cloudflare account it will use `wranger` to log in and deploy.
